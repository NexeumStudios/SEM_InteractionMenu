# SEM_InteractionMenu, forked by Nexeum Studios

If your server requires dynamic permission checking for a duty system, this version of SEM_InteractionMenu contains dynamic permission checking, so permissions are checked each time the menu is opened, instead of when the script is initially loaded.

It, in theory, works with every duty script that dynamically adds and removes permissions from a player. If you are looking for an advanced duty system, we recommend checking our our nex-duty script [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/advanced-duty-system-for-vmenu-servers/5324425).

If you have any issues with the script, reach out to us [here](https://discord.nexeumstudios.com)
